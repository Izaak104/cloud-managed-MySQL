# cloud-managed-MySQL

I created the MySQL Database on GCP
I also create virtual machine on GCP
I went through the process of updating the virtual machine and installing the relevant softwares
I connected the virtual machine to the database (I have included a picture to the repo showing the connection)
I following the class' and other examples and wrote the python code for creating the relevant tables among others
My challenge is using the code to connect the mysql database to the virtual machine and create the relevant tables in the the mysql database
